    In conventional speech processing applications, speech signal is encoded using fixed number of bits over the entire speech signal band. During the process, the bandwidth requirement for speech transmission is relatively high which is of concern. The QMF (Quadrature Mirror Filter) banks are the fundamental building blocks for spectral splitting. The MF structure allows spectral decomposition into contiguous overlapping sub bands in such a way that aliasing incurred in the initial “analysis” stage is eliminated during signal reconstruction by the “synthesis” stage. The technique is developed to design the so-called perfect reconstruction QMF bank, which allows complete elimination of amplitude and phase distortion of the reconstructed signal. A QMF bank can be formed from FIR or IIR filters. The aim of the paper is to design a QMF filter and then pass a speech signal through it. The low pass filtered signal is decimated and encoded with more number of bits and high pass filtered signal is also decimated and encoded with less number of bits. These two bit streams are multiplexed and transmitted. In receiver side the received signal is de-multiplexed and decoded. The signal is passed through the interpolators and then through the synthesis filter so as to reconstruct the speech signal .The reconstructed signal is compared with the original speech signal.

    <b>Title:</B>  Wireless Vision Based Mobile Robot Control Using Hand Gesture Recognition through Perceptual Color Space </b>
<P STYLE="margin-left:23% ;margin-right: 23%;">
    <B>DESCRIPTION</B> : We have implemented a wireless vision based mobile robot control through hand gesture recognition based on perceptual color space such as HIS, HSV/HSB, HSL. Vision-based hand gesture recognition is an important problem in the field of human-computer interaction, since hand motions and gestures could potentially be used to interact with computers in more natural ways. The robot control was done purely based on the orientation histograms a simple and fast algorithm on the system which would recognize static hand gestures with HSV color spaces as major parameters. The wireless based mobile robot system using hand gestures is a new innovative user interface that resolves the complications of using numerous remote controls for various applications. Based on one unified set of hand gestures, this system interprets the user hand gestures into pre-defined commands to control the remote robot. The experimental results are very encouraging as the system produces real-time responses and highly accurate recognition towards various gestures under different lighting conditions.
